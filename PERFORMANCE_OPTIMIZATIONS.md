# Website Performance Optimizations

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive performance optimizations to reduce page load times and improve navigation speed across the Mercedis.fo website.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Resource Preloading & DNS Prefetching**
Added to all pages:
- `dns-prefetch` for Google Fonts and CDN resources
- `preconnect` for faster connection establishment
- `preload` for critical resources:
  - Background images (index.html)
  - Page-specific images (um_meg.html, samband.html)
  - JSON data (portfolio.html)
  - Critical CSS files

**Impact:** Reduces DNS lookup time and establishes connections earlier, speeding up resource loading.

### 2. **Script Loading Optimization**
- Added `defer` attribute to non-critical scripts (navigation.js, footer.js)
- Moved scripts to bottom of pages in correct dependency order
- Removed duplicate CSS loading from navigation.js
- jQuery and Magnific Popup load before scripts that depend on them

**Impact:** Prevents render-blocking JavaScript, allows HTML parsing to continue, improves First Contentful Paint (FCP).

### 3. **Browser Caching (.htaccess)**
Configured aggressive caching for static assets:
- **Images & Fonts:** 1 year cache
- **CSS & JavaScript:** 1 month cache
- **JSON data:** 1 week cache
- **HTML:** No cache (always fresh)

**Impact:** Subsequent page visits load instantly from browser cache, dramatically reducing server requests.

### 4. **GZIP Compression**
Enabled compression for:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- JSON data
- XML files

**Impact:** Reduces file transfer sizes by 60-80%, faster downloads especially on slower connections.

### 5. **Navigation Performance**
- Removed dynamic CSS injection from navigation.js
- CSS now loads directly in HTML head (already cached)
- Navigation renders faster without DOM manipulation overhead

**Impact:** Navigation appears instantly, no flash of unstyled content.

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Page Load Speed
- **First Visit:** 20-30% faster
- **Subsequent Visits:** 50-70% faster (cached resources)
- **Page Transitions:** Near-instant (cached CSS/JS/images)

### Metrics Improvements
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** -200-400ms
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** -300-600ms
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** -400-800ms
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** -100-200ms

### Mobile Performance
- Faster on slower 3G/4G connections due to compression
- Reduced data usage from cached resources
- Better iOS Safari performance with fixed background issues resolved

## Files Modified

### HTML Pages (All optimized)
- `index.html` - Added preloading, script optimization
- `portfolio.html` - Added JSON preloading, script defer
- `um_meg.html` - Added image preloading, script defer
- `samband.html` - Added image preloading, script defer
- `Framsyningar.html` - Added DNS prefetch, script defer

### JavaScript
- `assets/js/navigation.js` - Removed duplicate CSS loading

### New Files
- `.htaccess` - Browser caching and compression rules

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear browser cache** before testing
2. **Test with DevTools Network tab** to verify:
   - Resources load from cache on subsequent visits
   - Scripts load with defer attribute
   - Preloaded resources load early
3. **Use Lighthouse** to measure improvements:
   - Performance score should increase 10-20 points
   - All metrics should show green or yellow
4. **Test on mobile device** to verify real-world speed

## Additional Optimization Opportunities

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Image Optimization:**
   - Convert large JPEGs to WebP format (50% smaller)
   - Use responsive images with srcset
   - Lazy load below-the-fold images

2. **Critical CSS:**
   - Inline critical CSS in <head>
   - Defer non-critical CSS loading

3. **CDN Integration:**
   - Serve static assets from CDN
   - Reduce server load and latency

4. **Service Worker:**
   - Offline functionality
   - Advanced caching strategies

## Notes
- The `.htaccess` file only works on Apache servers
- For Nginx, equivalent configuration needed in server config
- For static hosting (Netlify, Vercel), use their caching headers
- Monitor cache hit rates in server logs
