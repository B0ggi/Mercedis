# ðŸ“Š Umami Analytics Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Umami Cloud Account (Free)

1. **Go to**: https://cloud.umami.is/signup
2. **Sign up** with your email
3. **Verify** your email address
4. **Log in** to your dashboard

## Step 2: Add Your Website

1. In the Umami dashboard, click **"Add website"**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: `Mercedis Portfolio` (or your preferred name)
   - **Domain**: Your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `b0ggi.github.io` or your custom domain)
   - **Timezone**: Select your timezone (e.g., `Atlantic/Faroe`)
3. Click **"Save"**

## Step 3: Get Your Tracking Code

After adding your website, you'll see:
- **Website ID**: A unique ID (looks like: `abc123-def456-ghi789`)
- **Tracking Code**: A script tag

The tracking code looks like this:
```html
<script async src="https://cloud.umami.is/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-WEBSITE-ID"></script>
```

**Copy your Website ID** - you'll need it in the next step!

## Step 4: Add Your Website ID

1. Open the file: `assets/js/analytics.js`
2. Find line 19: `const UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID = 'YOUR-WEBSITE-ID-HERE';`
3. Replace `'YOUR-WEBSITE-ID-HERE'` with your actual Website ID
4. Save the file

Example:
```javascript
const UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID = 'abc123-def456-ghi789';
```

## Step 5: Deploy to GitHub

1. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Umami analytics"
   git push
   ```

2. **Wait** for GitHub Pages to deploy (1-2 minutes)
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
   - Wait for the green checkmark

3. **Visit your live site** (not localhost!)

4. **Check Umami dashboard** - You should see your visit appear within seconds!

## Troubleshooting

### Not seeing any data?

**Check:**
1. âœ… Website ID is correct in `analytics.js` (line 19)
2. âœ… Changes are pushed to GitHub
3. âœ… GitHub Pages has deployed successfully
4. âœ… You're visiting the LIVE site (not localhost)
5. âœ… Ad blockers are disabled (for testing)
6. âœ… Browser console shows no errors (press F12)

### Data delayed?

- Umami updates every few seconds
- Refresh the dashboard
- Check "Realtime" tab for instant updates

### Script not loading?

- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for `[Analytics] Umami loaded successfully` message
- Check Network tab for blocked requests
- Verify the script URL is correct

### Analytics not loading on localhost?

- This is **intentional** - analytics only work on your live site
- Prevents test visits from polluting your data
- You'll see: `[Analytics] Skipping Umami on localhost` in console
